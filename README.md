# ADSA
Welcome to my repository for ADSA (Analysis and Design of Algorithms)! Here, I will be uploading all the code implementations and solutions for various Data Structures and Algorithms that I work on throughout my college journey. This repository serves as a collection of my learning and practice in Algorithm Design, Problem Solving, and Data Structure Implementation.

It includes code for:

Basic and advanced data structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.)

Sorting algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc.)

Searching algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search)

Graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, etc.)

Dynamic Programming and Greedy algorithms

Divide and Conquer approaches

String processing algorithms and much more!

Feel free to explore, contribute, or ask any questions. This is a place where I aim to build a strong foundation in DSA and share the code for everyone to learn and grow together!
